Since then (a 48-game sample), he's averaged 122 and finished 2022 as good as anyone in SuperCoach. It's hard to see him slowing down, given his age (still under 30), his elite tackling numbers (number two in the comp), ability to avoid the tag (teams opted to tag the more damaging Dawson when playing the Crows), consistency (lowest score of 93 last year with 13 games over 120) and the fact the Crows have opted to recruit players outside the midfield in recent years, meaning his full time midfield role should remain. The limited trades make SuperCoach a different game to Fantasy, where I'm more prepared to pay a 'full' price for starting selection I think will be a top scorer as I'm going to need to trade them in at one point anyway. Last year, I started with Jack Macrae who was priced at 128, more than Laird this year.

He was top 4 in the Brownlow and won the player MVP, however he averaged the 12th most SuperCoach points amongst midfielders.

He wins 32% of his possessions contested (the top 8 mids averaged 47%) and averaged less than 4 clearances per game (Oliver, Miller, Laird and Neale are all 7.6). Contested possessions and clearances are gold in SuperCoach and coupled with the fact Brayshaw is clearly Fremantle's best midfielder, meaning he's subject to a tag most weeks, he's not a safe SuperCoach selection as he would appear to be from the outside.

It was an easy selection and looked like a great one, when he averaged 130 in the first half of the season and showed 2020 was no fluke. The issue with Neale is that he is clearly Brisbane's most damaging midfielder and teams quickly learnt that if they shut down Neale, they would shut down the Lions. This saw him averaged 110 for the second half of the season. He's a much improved footballer and his high contested rate (54%) and disposal efficiency (70%) means that he can score as well as any in SuperCoach if let run free. The recruitment of Josh Dunkley should improve the Lions' midfield depth and we might see Neale run free more in 2023, and while I think it will be hard for him to match his 123 average in 2021, I still think he'll be a top 8 mid.","54% contested into 70% effective means he'll produce top 8 numbers, despite the constant tag threat",none,none,none,3,3,29,12,1,150,25,-11,198,76, 13 / 25, 20 / 25, 4 / 25, 0 / 25, 0 / 25,83,83,86.53846154,85.85,82.5,none,none,0,0,0,0,0,none,none,122.8181818,0,130.3846154,-7,111.8888889,11,110.2,13,124,-1,124.9166667,-2,133.7368421,122.96,102.4705882,133.7368421,118.9166667,111.8636364,109,3,3,37,2,5,10,11,144.9515117,120.2832344,115,130.4192812,116.4698163,124.9376559,128.8288288,-10.77684211,20.48941176,-31.26625387,14.82017544,7.053030303,2.863636364,-3.636363636,29.96,70.1408626,53.83609438,3.44,4.52,7.64,28.83718956,70.44127769,46.78371283,3.968325922,5.324824605,6.468673419,Clearances

There were a few factors for the regression. He returned early from a preseason syndesmosis injury where he was initially meant to miss the first 4 games and, like we saw with Zach Merrett, took a while to look back to his best. He also lost inside minutes following the recruitment of George Hewett and Adam Cerra, down from 67% CBAs in 2021 to 55% in 2022. A full preseason should fix the first issue, however Carlton still have a stacked midfield and Walsh is more suited to the wing than Cripps, Hewett and Matt Kennedy. There's enough proof over the past 5 years that to be an elite Fantasy midfielder, the CBAs need to be above 65%, so Walsh's role in the preseason will be a big watch for me. His low contested rate (35%) and tackles (3.3) will always hold him back unless he gets more time inside. If he looks like their first-choice on-baller with 70% CBAs, he's a shot to break through the 120 barrier and become a top line SuperCoach mid. If he stays on the wing, I don't think he'll get the tackle opportunities to get the big scores needed from your gun mids. He's now had offseason surgery and will miss the start of the season, ruling him out of calculations.","Preseason syndesmosis and extra mids saw him regress for the first time in 2022, will need to bump his CBAs to 70%+ to get his contested rate and tackles up and push the top 8",none,none,none,13,11,17,28,5,138,5,-6,149,73, 8 / 20, 14 / 20, 4 / 20, 0 / 20, 0 / 20,23,46,46.25,55,49.5,none,none,0,0,0,0,0,none,none,110.95,0,117.2,-6,104.7,6,99,12,none,none,112.9473684,-2,117.0454545,110.95,117.0454545,101.1176471,86.90909091,none,none,22,14,9,56,86,none,none,133.975026,124.668275,124.7138398,114.4672702,109.4155844,none,none,-6.095454545,-6.095454545,15.92780749,14.20855615,none,none,none,32.1,74.60019124,35.17131699,4.15,3.3,4.4,28.83718956,70.44127769,46.78371283,3.968325922,5.324824605,6.468673419,Clearances

He's still yet to recapture his absolute best form, which saw him average 109 twice (in 2018 and 2019 if you exclude his injured score of 0). The drop in form could be put down to a number of things: added pressure from captaincy, less stoppages where he used to rely on high tackle numbers and the depth of the Giants' midfield group, forcing Cogs to spend a lot more time forward. With the departure of Hopper and Taranto, the 3rd reason will hopefully be fixed and we'll see Cogs return to a 70%+ CBA midfielder.

After missing 2021 with an ACL, Sicily had a career best season, averaging 113 points per game on the back of league leading marks and rebounds and top 10 1%ers, spoils, intercepts and kicks. He proved a bargain buy given his 30% discount for missing the full season and a good learning experience to know that with modern sports science, players can return at an elite level following an ACL (we saw the same with Witts last season). The Hawks are in total development mode which means a few things for Sicily's 2023 prospects. They aren't going to win many games, meaning the ball will be in the backline a lot, with plenty of kick-in opportunities. Sicily averaged 118 in losses compared to 106 in wins, so the team performance shouldn't impact his output. However, with Sam Mitchell's eye on the future, they could do some experimenting, which we saw towards the end of 2022 when Sicily went from the preferred kick-out player (31%) to at times actively not looking to take the kick-ins, giving them up to the youngsters in Day and Bramble. He was even thrown into some centre bounces. Those things combined makes me think we'll see similar output again and be a top 6 defender.

After finishing strong in 2021, averaging 129 in the second half of the season, we all thought the Tom Mitchell of old was back, after years of interruptions since breaking his leg in 2019. However, he missed the AAMI game with groin soreness which is never a good sign. That, combined with Sam Mitchell's desire to fast-track Hawthorn's rebuild and experiment with younger players through the midfield (53% CBAs compared to 70%+ in prior years) saw Tom Mitchell have his lowest SuperCoach average since his second season in the comp. He now finds himself at Collingwood, which is a massive win for his prospects, given they are contending and will certainly use Mitchell as a fulltime onballer. The only concern is the style Collingwood play (fast, low possession, move it forward) isn't conducive to high SuperCoach scoring. However, Mitchell can score in any environment if healthy and in the right role, so if he has an uninterrupted preseason, he becomes one of the early locks for me.","The move to a contender should see Mitchell return to being an elite SuperCoach player, making him an early lock at that price",none,none,none,36,37,21,24,2,123,-7,-33,142,40, 3 / 21, 9 / 21, 10 / 21, 1 / 21, 0 / 21,54,52,49,53.11111111,56.9,52,none,0,0,0,0,0,0,none,96,0,92.5,4,100.6666667,-5,102.4,-6,none,none,98.8,-3,128.5833333,96,117.2272727,113.5294118,zero,128.5833333,118.8636364,8,65,8,13,none,2,3,142.8703704,122.2490931,137.8319783,122.0019987,zero,142.4444444,145.5377574,-32.58333333,-21.22727273,3.697860963,-15.05392157,none,9.71969697,15.13286713,28.04761905,70.9801781,45.60568108,4.19047619,4.571428571,5.047619048,28.83718956,70.44127769,46.78371283,3.968325922,5.324824605,6.468673419,Clearances

However, he stagnated in 2022, reducing his average by 6 despite no Cunnington and increased CBAs minutes. A lot of that might have been due to how bad the Kangaroos were as scores are generally lower for losing teams and the Roos are that more often than not. The rise of LDU also took some ball off him, however long term this should be a good thing for Simpkins' prospects given LDU is now the Roos' best player and commands the oppositions' attention. I've seen enough from Simpkin to know that he can average 105-110 in a season, which would make him a nice selection at that price if it were to be this year.

Update: Jack Hayes preseason injury might hurt as they are now missing Marshall and King for the early rounds, meaning Marshall could be needed up forward.","With Ryder and Ratten gone, expect Marshall to fulfill his SuperCoach and real life potential he showed when he averaged 110 in just this 3rd season",none,none,none,10,10,6,2,2,119,-2,-18,173,54, 4 / 21, 5 / 21, 12 / 21, 6 / 21, 0 / 21,91,43,83,84.6,44.33333333,47,none,0,0,0,0,0,0,none,92,0,89.2,3,94.54545455,-3,106.8,-15,none,none,93.9,-2,110.25,92,103.25,103.1052632,110.25,62.83333333,57,45,82,34,45,13,233,231,140.1096033,110.1724138,121.7118998,112.4538177,114.675174,86.18581907,72.72727273,-18.25,-11.25,0.144736842,-7.144736842,47.41666667,5.833333333,none,16,66.35541984,54.9561538,3.619047619,3.142857143,5.904761905,16.13636364,58.46452845,63.64289849,3.5,2.340909091,11.04545455,HO to Adv

After years of 'more midfield time' discussions in the preseason which never eventuated, it looked like it was finally going to happen after he had over 50% CBAs in the preseason practice match and Longmire backed it up with comments suggesting the move was real. However, he continued to play majority forward with small stints in the midfield - 18% in the first half of the season. They reduced as the year went on and his 4% CBAs post byes were not much more than he'd been getting in prior years. He still managed to score pretty well for almost a pure forward, averaging 101 points per game for the H&A season. This is why he's such a tantalizing prospect, if he can average 101 with 11% CBAs, imagine what he could do with 50%+! As a pure forward though, there's no value in his price as there was last year.

In fact, he was the Pies' leading Fantasy scorer post their bye with 103. There are a few questions to ask for 2023. Does he remain in the backline or will he transition to the midfield? Will Collingwood play more of a high possession game style? Will opposition teams continue to lock down on him as we saw at times last season?

He looked more of his 2021 self post bye, but still lacked the scoring power of 2021. His season high of 178 came from 89% CBAs, and this is the CBA level we'd love him to be consistently. He's been a 68%-73% CBA ruckman the last two years, largely due to the interrupted preseasons. The hope of that reaching 80%+ took a hit in the preseason with the recruitment of Luke Jackson, who you'd think will ruck more than Rory Lobb did last season. Lobb averaged 20%, which isn't a heap, it was more Meek who took over 60% when playing. Meek is gone so the outlook for Darcy might not be as grim as some are predicting.

In fact, he scored more Fantasy points in the second half compared to the first, it just didn't suit the SuperCoach scoring methodology. Players typically take a big step in their 3rd season and I think we'll be seeing Gulden take over a few games in 2023. The question is can he become a keeper which he will need to be at that price to be a worthwhile selection? The fact he's likely to be a wing and not attend many centre bounces (10% in 2022) makes it hard.

Given he averaged 47 in the first 5 games (one as the sub), he comes into 2023 priced at 86, 11 points less than what he showed he can do as first ruck. With English and Marshall set to eclipse that, many are overlooking Cameron for 2023. However, he only attended 55% of the centre bounce ruck contests in 2022, given the Pies' preference to use him forward and play Cox in the ruck a bit. The offseason recruitment of McStay will likely see Cox pushed out of the side and McStay playing as second ruck, and there is no way he will be doing 45%. Therefore, Cameron could increase his usage to 70%+, meaning a bump in average could be on the cards.

The concern is that he could be managed, which we saw in parts of 2022 where he played sub-70% game time on a lot of occasions. It will be made easier now that Tom Mitchell will take the prime inside mid role. There is also risk of reinjury, which looking at 3 of his past 4 seasons you'd have to say he's now an injury prone player. The Pies also play a less possession heavy game style now than they did when Adams was going 110. However, if you're a high risk / high reward coach, then Adams could a nice unique.

There was hope he would return to the more SuperCoach-friendly role last season after Essendon landed Jake Kelly in the offseason, who plays that third tall defender role very well and could relieve Ridley of those defensive duties.

After a full preseason, he came out with a bang, scoring 157 in Round 1 and we all thought we were going to see the Matt Rowell promised to us in his debut season. This was short lived, averaging 84 the rest of the season. He plays completely inside with zero spread to get easy possession, highlighted by his 67% contested rate (top 8 mids 47%) incredibly low 1.2 marks per game (top 8 mids 4.3). He looked purely focused on his role which at times meant manning an opposition mid and winning the footy came second.

He was a popular mid-priced pick in 2021 following a change of clubs for more midfield time after averaging 108 in the second half of 2019 in a midfield role. After string of poor performances, he was banished from the midfield and played in defence. That defence role continued to last season before he badly injured his calf, missing the majority of the season.

However, as a small forward, he scores like any other small forward, not very well. In 2022, Wingard saw just 21% CBAs, like his other veteran Hawk teammates, well down on prior seasons. He didnt go on a 100 averaging stretch, which means hes priced at 64, the cheapest he's been since his debut season. If the forward role remains, theres a bit of value there but not enough to commit to.

He instead went down in scoring by 31 points per game and down in CBAs, even finding himself playing VFL football for a lot of it.

He averaged 97 in just his 2nd season, looking like becoming a star mid of the comp. However, he's dropped in average every season since, bottoming out last year to average just 56. He played just 46% in the midfield and certainly didn't suit the outside role he was forced to play. Mitchell and O'Meara's departures mean there are CBAs up for grabs at the Hawks. But what I've seen since Sam Mitchell has taken over doesn't give me confidence that Worpel will receive any of these. Mitchell doesn't want Worpel winning outside ball and demands him to play a role that isn't great for his SuperCoach scoring. He has to be a preseason watch regardless based on past scoring history and his price, 41 points less than his average in his 2nd season. A consistent midfield role would make but a decent midpriced option, I just think Sam Mitchell will give more time to Ward, McDonald, Newcombe and Moore meaning Worpel might not get that bump in CBAs.",A big fall from his early career scores and could get his chance to bounce back with the departures of key mids,none,none,none,113,116,119,none,33,83,-8,-41,88,8, 0 / 11, 0 / 11, 11 / 11, 7 / 11, 1 / 11,66,18,none,none,46.36363636,41.14285714,18,0,0,none,none,0,0,0,56.18181818,0,58.66666667,-3,45,11,none,none,none,none,61,-5,97.04545455,56.18181818,73.45,88.26666667,97.04545455,67.90909091,none,126,426,210,102,47,191,none,121.9164002,77.49326146,100.7672634,119.0378289,121.5166743,90.32697548,none,-40.86363636,-17.26818182,-14.81666667,-8.778787879,29.13636364,none,none,15.36363636,58.1653577,53.71153846,3.636363636,2.181818182,2.909090909,28.83718956,70.44127769,46.78371283,3.968325922,5.324824605,6.468673419,Clearances

In 2018 he averaged 93 in the last 5 games which made him a popular pick in 2019. In 2019, he started strong, averaging 91 in the first 5 before getting injured and interrupting his season. Unfortunately, it's been the same old story for Milera, who has more time off the park than on. He played 12 games last season and certainly looked like he'd missed a lot of football, averaging just 58 for the season in mixed roles. He enters 2023 with a full preseason under his belt and the word is that he's been moved back to his favourable half back position. He's a preseason watch for both role and confidence, because if he can average 85+, which he's shown he can, he'll prove a great mid-priced selection.

He returned from back-to-back ACL reconstructions to play in the finals, where he scored 100. This score isn't built into his price, so he's priced at a rookie-level price of 32. The mid-60-mark is what he averaged from 2019-2021 and if he returned to that level he'll made a decent level of cash and prove a worthy starting squad selection.

Finlay was forced to play mostly across half-forward but showed some great signs and from all reports was more advanced than his (half) brother who by contrast only came good during the second half of his draft year. We saw the similarities in Finlay's debut when he was thrown into the middle for the final quarter and racked up over 10 disposals. However, he hasnt shown much since.

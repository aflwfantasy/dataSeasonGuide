Since then (a 48-game sample), he's averaged 115 and finished 2022 the clear number one man in Fantasy. It's hard to see him slowing down, given his age (still under 30), his elite tackling numbers (number two in the comp), ability to avoid the tag (teams opted to tag the more damaging Dawson when playing the Crows), consistency (lowest score of 90 last year with 12 games over 120) and the fact the Crows have opted to recruit players outside the midfield in recent years, meaning his full time midfield role should remain. He's the early favourite for the number one scorer again this season, so if you're someone who likes locking in a captain option from Round 1, he's a safe bet for a top score. However, no winning team has started with a player priced over 116 since 2018, so my philosophies say to pick someone priced below this mark who you think can perform in line with the top players for the first few weeks and grab them when they come down a bit in price. This doesn't always work mind you, as 2018 was the year the top priced Tom Mitchell started with 156, 137 and 148 when priced at 127 and if you didn't own him, you were left behind.",Averaged 115 since midfield move and hard to see that changing,none,none,none,1,1,1,2,1,137,-10,0,163,90, 12 / 20, 16 / 20, 0 / 20, 0 / 20, 0 / 20,87,71,78.25,79.4375,none,none,none,0,0,0,0,none,none,none,120.35,0,112,8,128.7,-9,120.6,-1,none,none,121.9473684,-2,120.35,120.35,111.6818182,99.70588235,96.90909091,107.8,99.6,9,1,7,33,42,8,28,153.4098152,153.4098152,142.3522596,123.1831395,111.7751914,126.2295082,116.9014085,0,8.668181818,11.97593583,2.796791444,-10.89090909,8.2,3,14.2,18.75,2.65,0,0.35,8.1,14.66796966,14.71370328,4.255247469,0,0.358074365,6.019313111

It's mirrored his CBA% increase where he finally became a full-time inside midfielder in 2022, which saw him not just become a star in Fantasy but also in real life. His elite mix of tackling in the inside and then bobbing up for marks on the outside give him the ability to go really big, as shown by his 10 games over 120 and a high of 181. However, with Fyfe injury prone and Mundy retiring, Brayshaw's clearly Fremantle's best midfielder. This means he's subject to a tag most weeks. And when his game is built on uncontested possessions (32% contested, average of the top 8 mids is 47%), he can be restricted, which we saw last season with 5 games under 90. He's 23, they've added O'Meara and his TOG should increase a bit, so there's every chance Brayshaw will improve again. However, I'd be playing the odds that he has a sub-90 score or two in the first month or so and try to get him when he's a bit cheaper.","Elite mark/tackle combo give him the tools to be the best player in Fantasy, only thing stopping him is the weekly tag threat",none,none,none,2,2,2,15,2,129,-9,-1,181,78, 10 / 24, 15 / 24, 5 / 24, 0 / 24, 0 / 24,81,75.5,74.9,75.33333333,77,none,none,0,0,0,0,0,none,none,112.3636364,0,118.3076923,-6,103.7777778,8,102.2,10,124,-12,116.5454545,-5,113.3333333,113.3333333,104.25,95.51470588,69.54545455,66.8,none,23,2,23,49,166,175,none,142.7072403,142.7072403,132.2969543,126.7564403,97.95134443,100.4511278,none,0,9.083333333,8.735294118,25.96925134,2.745454545,none,none,14.75,14.58333333,4.666666667,0,0.5,6.208333333,14.66796966,14.71370328,4.255247469,0,0.358074365,6.019313111

The knock on him is his low kick-to-handball ratio and this is what stops him from being a 120 averaging uber premium. However, he's got the consistency to always be above the 110 mark, which he's done the majority of his career. Before last season, opposition teams put more attention into Petracca, which meant Oliver avoided the tag. However, the pendulum shifted in 2022 and Oliver copped his fair share of opposition attention.

This generally leads to sustainable scoring and ability to go big on any given day - as seen by his 8 scores over 120 and a high of 162. However, Mills is so good defensively and his versatility becomes a burden in Fantasy. There were many occasions last season when he was shifted to be loose man in defence or to a wing and play behind the ball. His CBAs dropped (65% pre bye and 42% post) which coincided with a decrease in scoring (114 to 108).

He averaged an absurd 134 post bye in 2021, meaning a lot of coaches paid up thinking he was worth the $1m. However, he started the season 'slow', averaging 110 in his first 8 games and dropped $89k. This is the risk of paying top dollar in your starting squad, the price changes in the first few weeks are enhanced as the magic number stabilises. Unfortunately, things got worse for owners as Steele hurt his AC joint in Round 9, limiting him to a 77. He returned after missing five games and looked more like the Steele of old, averaging 115 the rest of the way, including an uncharacteristic 65 in Round 22. Steele's rise to the Fantasy elite coincided with Ratten taking over as coach and relinquishing him of his tagging duties. It will be interesting to see what role Ross Lyon has for him, but it is hard to see Steele not being their primary inside midfielder again. Of all the top priced midfielders, I've got him outperforming his price and we should see him produce at least the 115 he did to finish the year.","115 post injury should be the least he can do, as long as the new coach keeps him in his role",none,none,none,5,4,9,6,1,127,1,-10,154,65, 5 / 18, 14 / 18, 2 / 18, 1 / 18, 0 / 18,78,74,79.4,83.64285714,66.5,74,none,0,0,0,0,0,0,none,110.6666667,0,106.5555556,4,114.7777778,-4,111.4,0,none,none,113.3529412,-2,121.3636364,110.4444444,121.3636364,113.4210526,96.15,94.4,92.8,7,4,2,9,44,37,42,142.7807487,129.7650131,142.7807487,132.6970443,114.0569395,118.7421384,122.5891678,-10.91919192,-10.91919192,7.942583732,17.27105263,1.75,1.6,21.2,12.61111111,14.5,5,0,0.277777778,7.166666667,14.66796966,14.71370328,4.255247469,0,0.358074365,6.019313111

His issues in the past from a Fantasy perspective have been his health and attention from opposition players. If last year was anything to go by, he looks in full fitness and teams opted to tag Saad more than Docherty, which is great for Docherty's Fantasy prospects. He finished the season playing as an inside mid, purely due to the injuries to Carlton's regular midfielders, but this is something to watch for as he showed a tackle and ball winning ability that suggest he could be in the Laird/Mills mould of Fantasy defenders turned midfielders.

There is no harder working midfielder in the comp, so he managed to still put up some decent scores when tagged, thanks to his 6 tackles per game. The hope is that Anderson and Rowell take the next step in 2023 which might see Miller avoid the tag, however I still believe he'll be locked down at times.

It was an easy selection and looked like a great one, when he averaged 116 in the first half of the season and showed 2020 was no fluke. The issue with Neale is that he is clearly Brisbane's most damaging midfielder and teams quickly learnt that if they shut down Neale, they would shut down the Lions. This saw him average a very mediocre 95 for the second half of the season. This is the concern with Neale and while he has the ability to average 120 and be the best Fantasy mid in the comp, he'll come with the tag risk every week. The recruitment of Josh Dunkley should improve the Lions' midfield depth and we might see Neale run free more in 2023, however I doubt it will happen enough for him to return to his 2020 heights.","The 'shut down Neale, beat Brisbane' makes it hard for him to average 110+",none,none,none,8,9,29,31,2,124,5,-13,145,60, 5 / 25, 14 / 25, 5 / 25, 2 / 25, 0 / 25,83,83,86.4,87.78571429,81.4,86.5,none,0,0,0,0,0,0,none,107,0,115.6153846,-9,94.55555556,12,96.2,11,93,14,107.2083333,0,120.3289474,105.32,97.41176471,120.3289474,103.5416667,100.2,100.1,10,11,36,3,21,26,26,136.1519608,120.2832344,115,130.4192812,116.4698163,124.9376559,128.8288288,-15.00894737,7.908235294,-22.91718266,16.7872807,3.341666667,0.1,-11,13.84,16.12,3.84,0,0.44,4.52,14.66796966,14.71370328,4.255247469,0,0.358074365,6.019313111

For context, Andy Brayshaw went at 141 last year, Oliver 131, Mills 130 and Miller 127. However, he struggled for a constant inside role at the Saints given their midfield mix are all very similar and one paced, which saw Crouch often pushed out and spend less than ideal CBA for a Fantasy midfielder (62% in 2022). However, this didn't matter and he managed to return to be a Fantasy gun in the limited role. I like my Fantasy mids to have high TOG and CBAs, which rules Crouch out if he remains at 62%.

When he's up and about and in the right role, there are few better. He averaged 130 in the second half of 2019 when he moved off the wing to pure inside mid. 123 in the first half of 2021 when his CBAs were at 80%. However, when he doesn't get the role he wants, he looks a shadow of himself. Unfortunately, it was this way for the majority of 2022. The Dogs' midfield is stacked and Macrae saw a 5 year low 64% CBAs, which explains his 3rd lowest average in 10 seasons in the league. At 28, typically the peak age for Fantasy, he should be producing career high numbers. Dunkley leaving opens up an obvious spot in the midfield. However, the Dogs' preferred midfield mix has been Libba, Bont and Smith, so Macrae's not certain to pick up the extra inside minutes. He's a big preseason watch and if he gets his CBAs back to the mid-70s, he could be the perfect discount uber premium we are hunting for as our M1/M2. However, if he takes Hunter's spot on a wing, we can no longer count him as a safe 110 midfielder.","Coming off his 3rd lowest average in 10 seasons with low CBAs, if he gets Dunkley's extra mid time he could be the ideal discounted uber premium",none,none,none,11,11,8,37,1,120,-6,-19,148,72, 5 / 23, 13 / 23, 5 / 23, 0 / 23, 0 / 23,59,74,64.2,65.61538462,64.6,none,none,0,0,0,0,0,none,none,103.3636364,1,107.4166667,-3,98.5,6,90.4,14,123,-19,105.6818182,-2,122.6,104.2173913,116.2307692,112.2916667,116.2173913,122.6,104,5,13,3,11,2,2,17,142.8904429,130.2717391,140.2971216,132.0215545,136.2454763,142.8904429,121.0710128,-18.3826087,-12.01337793,3.939102564,-3.925724638,-6.382608696,18.6,5.2,14.86956522,15.7826087,4.173913043,0,0.173913043,3.782608696,14.66796966,14.71370328,4.255247469,0,0.358074365,6.019313111

There were a few factors for the regression. He returned early from a preseason syndesmosis injury where he was initially meant to miss the first 4 games and, like we saw with Zach Merrett, took a while to look back to his best. He also lost inside minutes following the recruitment of George Hewett and Adam Cerra, down from 67% CBAs in 2021 to 55% in 2022. A full preseason should fix the first issue, however Carlton still have a stacked midfield and Walsh is more suited to the wing than Cripps, Hewett and Matt Kennedy. There's enough proof over the past 5 years that to be an elite Fantasy midfielder, the CBAs need to be above 65%, so Walsh's role in the preseason will be a big watch for me. If he looks like their first-choice on-baller with 70% CBAs, he's a shot to break through the 110 barrier and become a top 8 mid. If he stays on the wing, I don't think he'll get the tackle opportunities to get the big scores needed from your gun mids (only 1 game over 120 in 2022, 0 over 130). He's now had offseason surgery and will miss the start of the season, ruling him out of calculations.","Preseason syndesmosis and extra mids saw him regress for the first time in 2022, will need to bump his CBAs to 70%+ to get more 120s and push the top 8",none,none,none,11,12,17,21,7,120,-2,-5,128,79, 1 / 20, 11 / 20, 4 / 20, 0 / 20, 0 / 20,64,46,64,52.36363636,59.5,none,none,0,0,0,0,0,none,none,103.35,1,106.4,-2,100.3,4,99.5,5,none,none,104.6315789,-1,108.9545455,103.35,108.9545455,96.69117647,91.90909091,none,none,38,14,13,41,61,none,none,124.7138398,124.668275,124.7138398,114.4672702,109.4155844,none,none,-5.604545455,-5.604545455,12.26336898,4.782085561,none,none,none,14.3,17.8,4.55,0,0.25,3.3,14.66796966,14.71370328,4.255247469,0,0.358074365,6.019313111

He's still been the number 1 ruck in Fantasy during this time, so it has a lot to do with the ruck role with the reduced stoppages and ruck influence since the introduction of the stand rule. He's also given up CBAs to up-and-coming ruck, Luke Jackson, from 93% in 2020 to just 66% in 2022. The good news is Jackson is gone. The bad news is Melbourne now have the fellow best Fantasy ruck of the last decade, Brodie Grundy. This makes Gawn (and Grundy's) Fantasy prospects incredibly difficult to predict.

He scoring appears sustainable, with a nice blend of intercept possessions, kick-ins (64% in the last 5) and general play. The only times he looked vulnerable were when the tag came, which happened a bit in the second half of the season, reducing his average to 93 in the last 5 games.

The risk that was flagged was how deep the Giants were in their midfield, with Hopper, Ward, Taranto, Kelly, Green and Coniglio all demanding time.

He's still yet to recapture his absolute best form, which saw him average 111 twice (in 2018 and 2019 if you exclude his injured score of 0). The drop in form could be put down to a number of things: added pressure from captaincy, less stoppages where he used to rely on high tackle numbers and the depth of the Giants' midfield group, forcing Cogs to spend a lot more time forward. With the departure of Hopper and Taranto, the 3rd reason will hopefully be fixed and we'll see Cogs return to a 70%+ CBA midfielder.

That, combined with Sam Mitchell's desire to fast-track Hawthorn's rebuild and experiment with younger players through the midfield (53% CBAs compared to 70%+ in prior years) saw Tom Mitchell have his lowest Fantasy average since his second season in the comp. He now finds himself at Collingwood which is a massive win for his prospects, given they are contending and will certainly use Mitchell as a fulltime onballer. The only concern is the style Collingwood play (fast, low possession, move it forward) isn't conducive to high Fantasy scoring. However, Mitchell can score in any environment if healthy and in the right role, so if he has an uninterrupted preseason, he becomes one of the early locks in Fantasy.","The move to a contender should see Mitchell return to being an elite Fantasy player, making him an early lock at that price",none,none,none,28,26,21,28,1,113,-7,-32,120,51, 0 / 21, 10 / 21, 8 / 21, 1 / 21, 0 / 21,49,52,none,54,52.875,52,none,0,0,none,0,0,0,none,96.28571429,0,95.66666667,0,97.11111111,-1,98.4,-2,none,none,98.55,-3,128.2,96.28571429,115.5909091,107.7205882,zero,128.2,127.2,1,36,5,18,none,1,1,145.5377574,122.2490931,137.8319783,122.0019987,zero,142.4444444,145.5377574,-31.91428571,-19.30519481,7.870320856,-20.47941176,none,1,22.5,11.38095238,16.66666667,3.857142857,0,0.238095238,4.571428571,14.66796966,14.71370328,4.255247469,0,0.358074365,6.019313111

However, he stagnated in 2022, not increasing his average despite no Cunnington and increased CBAs minutes. A lot of that might have been due to how bad the Kangaroos were as scores are generally lower for losing teams and the Roos are that more often than not.

He averaged 114 between rounds 4-11, including a 157 and 169, then it all went wrong. He was concussed in Round 12 just after quarter time when on 44 and on track to get 150 again.

He never returned the same player, averaging 79 in the last 5 and 71 in the finals, often receiving a heavy tag from opposition forwards. When Cats were at their best, which they were over that time, they played on and moved the ball quick. This doesn't play into the hands of Stewart, who when on a tear, does it through multiple marks at will. It's hard to predict Stewarts' prospects for 2023. On one hand, there's the fact he gets a lot of opposition attention (not ideal for a Fantasy defender), he's now 30 in a team who notoriously rests their older players and that the Cats' style has evolved and they don't take as many marks.

However, I like to look for a discount wherever I can and those same people would've missed out on someone like Sicily. There is no right answer, but one thing we have learnt is that it's very hard to trust someone with soft tissue injuries. Crouch, who was once a dominant midfielder of the comp both in real life and in Fantasy, had his lowest season average since his second season of 88. He also struggled for regular games, playing just 11 for the season and 1 of the last 9. He clearly fell out of favour to the younger Sam Berry and Schoenberg. When he did play, he was restricted to just 67% TOG.

He attended 51% and scored a then season high of 114. A defender who played inside was certainly interesting, however it was short-lived after he injured his ribs 2 games later on 31 and missed the last 6 games. He did return to the midfield , highlighted by a 132 from 90% CBAs in Round 22. A defender priced at 87 who attended centre bounces and can score 130s is attractive, however McVeigh is gone and I doubt he'll be used in the middle for Kingsley, despite the loss of Hopper and Taranto.

Last season was a mix of big scores when given midfield time (2 scores over 120 when averaging 52% CBAs), low scores (5 under 70 from 26% CBAs), injuries (MCL injury when on 44 before half time) and duds (a 34 when sick all week). However, when he had full fitness and played in the right role, he showed he can be a top 6 forward after all, averaging 107 in his last 5 games. The forward line is getting crowded with a number of great starting options and Butters takes on more risk - role and injury due to his bash-and-crash nature - than the others.

He broke a thumb, had sore groins and then an Achilles injury that kept him out of the first practice match and Round 1. It's the second interrupted preseason in a row for Darcy after his knee injury in 2021 and it showed, scoring 47 in the AAMI and 83 in pre bye.

He's been a 68%-73% CBA ruckman the last two years, largely due to the interrupted preseasons. The hope of that reaching 80%+ took a hit in the preseason with the recruitment of Luke Jackson, who you'd think will ruck more than Rory Lobb did last season. Lobb averaged 20%, which isn't a heap, it was more Meek who took over 60% when playing. Meek is gone so the outlook for Darcy might not be as grim as some are predicting. I think he'll ruck 70% which is what he did in the last half for a 90 average, it's just hard to see him being a top 2 ruck, which he could've been without Jackson given he's heading into his peak-ruck period of season 7.","Ready to breakout after 2 interrupted preseasons in a row, however the arrival of Jackson will put a cap on that",none,none,none,7,8,8,6,3,103,-5,-8,147,45, 3 / 21, 4 / 21, 13 / 21, 6 / 21, 0 / 21,89,45,82.66666667,80,70.38461538,59.66666667,none,0,0,0,0,0,0,none,85.84210526,0,82.6,3,89.44444444,-3,89.6,-4,90.5,-5,90.63157895,-5,93.71428571,86.28571429,93.71428571,64.58333333,68.63636364,73.4,83.6,106,81,49,228,175,132,78,115.7647059,107.6009501,115.7647059,83.15450644,81.13045347,86.35294118,99.40546968,-7.428571429,-7.428571429,29.13095238,-4.053030303,-4.763636364,-10.2,none,7,7.142857143,2.428571429,33.9047619,0.476190476,2.619047619,11.64772727,6.860795455,5.491477273,25.38920455,0.639204545,2.190340909

There's no doubt he's a very good Fantasy scorer when on the park (highlighted by his 132 from 10 VFL games in 2019), but he's become too hard to trust.

His scoring is boosted by above average kick-to-handball ratio, marks, goals and tackles. With all this combined, he's a unique player who doesn't require 30 touches to get a decent Fantasy score.

He averaged 93 in the 16 games since and showed enough that the Pies traded Grundy at season end, meaning he'll be their main man next year. Given he averaged 48 in the first 5 games (one as the sub), he comes into 2023 priced at 82, 11 points less than what he showed he can do as first ruck. With English and Marshall set to eclipse that, many are overlooking Cameron for 2023. However, he only attended 55% of the centre bounce ruck contests in 2022, given the Pies' preference to use him forward and play Cox in the ruck a bit.

He looked back to full fitness and went at 107 post bye. I thought he was underpriced in 2022, however it was a groin issue that restricted him all year, playing a career low 73% game time, and finally gave way with a complete rupture of his adductor in the final. He's recovered well and should be right to get enough preseason in before Round 1. Therefore, he becomes a discounted option for 2023 being priced at 82. The concern is that he could be managed, which we saw in parts of 2022 where he played sub-70% game time on a lot of occasions. It will be made easier now that Tom Mitchell will take the prime inside mid role. There is also risk of reinjury, which looking at 3 of his past 4 seasons you'd have to say he's now an injury prone player.

But he lacked the inside strength and tackling game to generate consistent 'uber-premium' 115+ scores.

The intercept defender, who was the Bombers’ main distributor at the time, lost the majority of his kick-in duties and went from a loose marking defender who left his man at any opportunity to get involved and intercept, to a lock-down defender matching up on one of the opposition's dangerous forwards. There was hope he would return to the more Fantasy-friendly role last season after Essendon landed Jake Kelly in the offseason, who plays that third tall defender role very well and could relieve Ridley of those defensive duties. While Kelly did this to some extent, the emergence of Redman meant that Ridley took a back seat in 2022, reducing his averaging just 76.

He looked purely focused on his role which at times meant manning an opposition mid and winning the footy came second. The reports from the Suns were only positive though and he did was top 5 in the AFL for tackles, pressure acts and defensive half pressure acts. So maybe the role was just part of his development and he'll soon be unleased to win more of the footy.

He was a popular mid-priced pick in 2021 following a change of clubs for more midfield time after averaging 106 in the second half of 2019 in a midfield role. After string of poor performances, he was banished from the midfield and played in defence. That defence role continued to last season before he badly injured his calf, missing the majority of the season.

However, as a small forward, he scores like any other small forward, not very well. In 2022, Wingard saw just 21% CBAs, like his other veteran Hawk teammates, well down on prior seasons. He didn’t go on a 100 averaging stretch, which means he’s priced at 56, the cheapest he's been since his debut season. If the forward role remains, there’s a bit of value there but not enough to commit to. However, if he looks to be the one to take up the midfield slack from Mitchell and O’Meara leaving, then he should be on your radar for Round 1.

He played just 46% in the midfield and certainly didn't suit the outside role he was forced to play. Mitchell and O'Meara's departures mean there are CBAs up for grabs at the Hawks. But what I've seen since Sam Mitchell has taken over doesn't give me confidence that Worpel will receive any of these. Mitchell doesn't want Worpel winning outside ball and demands him to play a role that isn't great for his Fantasy scoring. He has to be a preseason watch regardless based on past scoring history and his price, 45 points less than his average in his 2nd season.

He was having a career best season in 2020 when playing in the midfield (46% CBAs) before it was cut short due to injury. He went at 95 in the first five rounds and was averaging an adjusted 84 until scoring a zero in his last game, dragging his season average down to 73. He then played as a defender when he returned in 2021, going from 46% CBAs to 0% and averaging just 61 points per game. He played forward in his limited opportunities last season, averaging 52 but that included 4 games with less than 50% game time. He dominated in the WAFL to average 99, so he can score when in the right role.

Unfortunately, it's been the same old story for Milera, who has more time off the park than on. He played 12 games last season and certainly looked like he'd missed a lot of football, averaging just 50 for the season in mixed roles. He enters 2023 with a full preseason under his belt and the word is that he's been moved back to his favourable half back position. He's a preseason watch for both role and confidence, because if he can average 80+, which he's shown he can, he'll prove a great mid-priced selection.

He made the step up to seniors, averaging 96 in the WAFL this season and had some chances at AFL level, playing 4 games. 2 of those he had less than 50% game time as sub, so his 58 average isn't the best read.

His season was delayed due to an AC injury, but he debuted in Round 7 and didn't disappoint, scoring 110. He missed the following week with COVID protocols and then never reached those heights again. Outside of his debut, I was underwhelmed by him and despite him still being 25, I think he might struggle for games in the full strength West Coast line-up. If he is a first choice mid in the preseason, there's some value at that price given what we know he can do, but he's been used on a wing at AFL level and I doubt he'll get the inside minutes.","Monster junior scores and on debut looked to be Barlow 2.0, but didn't go on with it and now unlikely to have an inside role",none,none,none,126,125,92,112,125,64,-18,-1,110,0, 0 / 9, 1 / 9, 8 / 9, 7 / 9, 4 / 9,8,21,none,8,21.5,19.57142857,12.75,0,0,none,0,0,0,0,48.44444444,-1,73,-26,17.75,29,12,35,none,none,54.5,-8,48.44444444,48.44444444,none,none,none,none,none,543,465,none,none,none,none,none,89.3442623,89.3442623,none,none,none,none,none,0,none,none,none,none,none,none,5.777777778,5.111111111,2.666666667,0,0.111111111,3.444444444,14.66796966,14.71370328,4.255247469,0,0.358074365,6.019313111

The 60-mark is what he averaged from 2019-2021 and if he returned to that level he'll made a decent level of cash, but the scoring wouldn't be worth the extra cash from a rookie. However, he's averaged 94 at AFL level before in 2018, and in that year he was going at 105 in the first half. He also averaged 96 in the VFL last year, so on that form he can surpass the ’60-mark’.
